# Backend Server Deployment Guide

## 🔍 What is Your Backend Server?

Your backend server is the Express.js API in the `server/` folder that handles:
- Authentication (login, signup)
- Case management
- Payments
- AI services
- File uploads
- All API endpoints

**Currently:** It only runs on `localhost:3000` (your computer)

**You need to:** Deploy it to a cloud platform so it's accessible on the internet

## 📍 Where is Your Backend Server?

### Currently: ❌ Not Deployed
- Location: Only runs on your local machine
- URL: `http://localhost:3000` (only works on your computer)
- Status: **Not accessible from Vercel deployment**

### You Need: ✅ Deployed to Cloud
- Location: A cloud hosting platform
- URL: `https://your-backend.railway.app` (or similar)
- Status: **Accessible from anywhere on the internet**

## 🔧 Configure Vercel to Use Your Backend

Once you have your backend URL:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your `enyayasetu` project

2. **Settings → Environment Variables:**
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `VITE_API_URL`
   - Value: Your backend URL (e.g., `https://enyayasetu-backend.up.railway.app`)
   - **Do NOT include `/api`** - the code adds it automatically
   - Apply to: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click the "..." menu on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Or push a new commit to trigger redeploy

---

## ✅ Verify It's Working

After deployment:

1. **Test Backend Health:**
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

2. **Test API Endpoint:**
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api`
   - Should return JSON with available endpoints

3. **Test from Frontend:**
   - Your Vercel app should now successfully call the backend
   - Login should work!

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

1. **Deploy backend** to Railway/Render/Fly.io → Get URL
2. **Add `VITE_API_URL`** environment variable in Vercel → Set to your backend URL
3. **Redeploy** Vercel app → Done!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Backend URL Not Working?
- Check backend logs in Railway/Render dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test `/health` endpoint in browser

### Still Getting 404 Errors?
- Make sure `VITE_API_URL` doesn't include `/api` at the end
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh
- Check Vercel build logs for any errors

### Database Connection Issues?
- Verify DB credentials in backend environment variables
- Check that database allows connections from backend IP
- Test database connection locally first

## 📝 Example Configuration

**Backend deployed on Railway:**
- Backend URL: `https://enyayasetu-api.up.railway.app`
- Vercel `VITE_API_URL`: `https://enyayasetu-api.up.railway.app`

**Backend deployed on Render:**
- Backend URL: `https://enyayasetu-backend.onrender.com`
- Vercel `VITE_API_URL`: `https://enyayasetu-backend.onrender.com`

The frontend will automatically append `/api` when making requests, so the final URL will be:
- `https://your-backend-url.com/api/auth/signin` ✅
